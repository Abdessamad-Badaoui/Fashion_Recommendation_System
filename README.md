# Fashion Recommendation System Using Image Features

This project implements a Fashion Recommendation System that leverages computer vision and machine learning to recommend fashion items based on visual similarities. The system analyzes key visual features of fashion items, such as color, texture, and style, to suggest products that are either similar or complementary to a user's input.
### Key Features:

   **Dataset Preparation**: A diverse set of fashion images is collected and preprocessed to ensure consistency in format and resolution.
    
   **Feature Extraction**: A pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, namely VGG16, is utilized to extract deep visual features from the images.
   
   **Similarity Measurement**: The system calculates the similarity between the feature vectors of different fashion items.
   
   **Recommendation Engine**: Based on the similarity scores, the system ranks and recommends the most visually similar items to the user.

This project demonstrates the application of advanced machine learning techniques in fashion retail, providing personalized recommendations that enhance the shopping experience.
